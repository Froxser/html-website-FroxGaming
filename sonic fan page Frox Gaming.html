          <h3 style="color:Blue;">About my studies of sonic the hedghog</h3>
        
        
        <p style="color:Blue;"> I have been playing sonic the hedgehog since 2019. I was 14 when i started learning more about the franchice, and I enjoyed it. I think sonic is a facinating creature, because he is a blue hedgehog that can run at the speed of sound. He has a sidekick, tails, that is a fox with two tails. He also has an echidna allie that is skinny but very powerful. I just think that sonic the hedgehog is very facinating and I wanna learn more about him. I will have gameplay bellow this, plus some things machines that eggman made that are very cool and some sonic fan game stuff too, like from roblox. I hope you enjoyed this as much as I do.</p>
          
          <p style="color:Blue;">02/26/2021: So far in my sonic the hedgehog adventure, i have found many great fan games and emulators that play great sonic games on them. I have played Sonic Onset Adventure on roblox, along with Classic Sonic Simulator, and Sonic Dash Beta. These sonic fan games on roblox are actually good. If people are reading this, they really need to check this. You can see at the bottem of the page that I added some new things to this page. To be honest, this is the page that i work on the most. This is Froxser the Fox saying, ima head out now.</p>
